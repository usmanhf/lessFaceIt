<h1>About US</h1>
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
<p>Increase doctor-patient interaction by reducing the amount of time the doctor spends on the computer. (presented by BlueChasm)<br></p>
<h2>Our Solution</h2>
<p>We are creating a website that incorporates state of the art technology to streamline the extensive sign-in process. A camera will be used in conjunction with Microsoftâ€™s Face API to recognize the doctors and patients. The respective information will then be pulled up, allowing for maximum interaction between the doctor and patient.<br></p>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>We are a group of passionate sophomores from UT Austin and Texas A&M who want to make a difference. Helping to increase human-to-human interaction is what drives us to create new and unique ways of using technology.</p>
